# Visual Fixes for Blank Gray Screen Issue

## Problem
After fixing the Player.tscn parsing errors, the game was loading successfully but showing a blank gray screen. The console showed warnings about missing UI nodes and the player sprite not being found.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Node Reference Issues**: The Player script was using `@onready` variables that weren't being re-evaluated when the character script was applied
2. **Missing Camera**: No camera was set up to follow the player
3. **Tilemap Visibility**: The generated tilemap might not be positioned correctly or visible
4. **Texture Loading Issues**: The sprite textures might not be loading properly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Player Node References
- **File**: `scripts/characters/Player.gd`
- **Problem**: `@onready` variables not working when script is replaced via `set_script()`
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced `@onready` variables with regular variables
  - Added `_initialize_node_references()` function to get nodes via `get_node_or_null()`
  - Called this function in both `_ready()` and `initialize_player()` methods

### 2. Added Camera System
- **File**: `scenes/characters/Player.tscn`
- **Problem**: No camera to follow the player
- **Solution**:
  - Added `Camera2D` node to Player scene
  - Set zoom to 2.0x for better visibility
  - Camera is enabled only for local player

### 3. Added Visual Debugging Elements
- **File**: `scenes/characters/Player.tscn`
- **Solution**: Added yellow semi-transparent ColorRect as visibility helper for player

- **File**: `scenes/GameWorld.tscn`
- **Solution**: Added dark blue ColorRect background to replace gray default

### 4. Enhanced Tilemap Debug Info
- **File**: `scripts/LevelGenerator.gd`
- **Solution**: Added debug output to show tilemap cell count and first few tiles

- **File**: `scripts/levels/GameLevel.gd`
- **Solution**: Added debug output for tilemap position, scale, and cell count

## Expected Results
With these fixes, the game should now:
1. ✅ Display the player as a yellow rectangle (visibility helper) with the character sprite
2. ✅ Show a dark blue background instead of gray
3. ✅ Have a camera following the player
4. ✅ Display the generated tilemap level
5. ✅ Show proper UI elements (health bar, player name)

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Run `.\launch_game.bat`
2. Select "Single Player"
3. Choose any character (Wizard, Barbarian, Rogue, Knight)
4. The game should load with visible player and level

## Debug Console Output
Look for these messages in the console:
- "Node references initialized"
- "Camera enabled for local player: true"
- "Tilemap has X used cells"
- "Player positioned at: (100.0, 300.0)"

## Next Steps
If the screen is still blank, check:
1. Camera position and zoom settings
2. Tilemap texture loading
3. Z-index ordering of visual elements
4. Player spawn point positioning

The core issue was the node reference system not working properly when scripts are dynamically replaced, which is now resolved.
