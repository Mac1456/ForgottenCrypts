# Character Selection Crash Fix

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Vulkan Overlay Errors**: Epic Games Launcher overlay files missing causing crashes
2. **Audio Loading Hang**: AudioManager trying to load missing audio files causing game freeze
3. **OpenGL Renderer**: Switched from Vulkan to OpenGL to avoid overlay issues

## Solutions Applied:

### 1. âœ… AudioManager Fixed
- Made audio loading non-blocking
- Graceful handling of missing audio files
- Game continues without audio if files are missing

### 2. âœ… OpenGL Renderer Forced
- Updated `project.godot` to use OpenGL3 renderer
- Added launch scripts that force OpenGL
- Disabled Vulkan validation layers

### 3. âœ… Placeholder Audio Files
- Created script to generate placeholder audio files
- Prevents missing file errors

## How to Test:

### Method 1: Run from Godot Editor (Recommended)
1. Open project in Godot Editor
2. Press F5 to run
3. Try character selection - should work without crashes

### Method 2: Use Launch Scripts
1. Double-click `launch_game.bat` or `launch_game.ps1`
2. This forces OpenGL renderer with environment variables

### Method 3: Create Audio Files (Optional)
1. In Godot Editor, open `create_placeholder_audio.tscn`
2. Run the scene to create placeholder audio files
3. This prevents audio loading errors

## Expected Results:
- âœ… No more Vulkan errors
- âœ… No more audio loading hangs
- âœ… Smooth character selection
- âœ… Game proceeds to GameWorld scene without crashes

## If Issues Persist:
1. Check console output for any remaining errors
2. Run `debug_character_selection.tscn` to test individual components
3. Try Method 2 (launch scripts) if Editor doesn't work

## Debug Tools Available:
- `debug_character_selection.tscn` - Tests character selection flow
- `create_placeholder_audio.tscn` - Creates missing audio files
- `launch_game.bat` / `launch_game.ps1` - Force OpenGL renderer

Your game should now work without crashes after character selection! ðŸŽ®
