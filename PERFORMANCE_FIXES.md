# Performance Fixes for Level Generation Freeze

## Problem
The game was freezing during level generation, specifically when creating the tilemap. The logs showed:
- Game reached "Generated 3 rooms" 
- Froze during tilemap creation process
- Main thread became unresponsive

## Root Cause
The tilemap creation process was too intensive, processing 1,200 tiles (40x30) in batches of 500 without adequate yielding control back to the engine. Even with `await Engine.get_main_loop().process_frame`, the synchronous processing within batches was causing the main thread to hang.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Ultra-Small Batch Processing
- **Before**: 500 tiles per batch
- **After**: 50 tiles per batch (90% reduction)
- **Fallback**: 25 tiles per batch for minimal level

### 2. Timeout Protection System
- Added 5-second timeout for full level generation
- Automatic fallback to minimal level if timeout exceeded
- Progress tracking at each generation phase

### 3. Fallback Level System
- **Minimal Level**: 20x15 tiles (300 total) vs 40x30 (1,200 total)
- **Single Room**: Simple rectangular room with walls and floor
- **Guaranteed Success**: Always completes within reasonable time

### 4. Enhanced Async Processing
- More frequent yielding (every 50 tiles vs 500)
- Better progress logging (every 200 tiles)
- Timeout checks during tilemap creation

## Code Changes

### Modified Files
1. **`scripts/LevelGenerator.gd`**
   - Added `_try_generate_full_level()` function
   - Added `_create_fallback_level()` function  
   - Added `_create_tilemap_safe()` function
   - Added `_create_tilemap_minimal()` function
   - Replaced `_create_tilemap()` with safer alternatives

### Key Functions Added

```gdscript
# Main generation with fallback
func generate_level(level_type: LevelType, seed_value: int = -1) -> TileMap:
    var tilemap = await _try_generate_full_level(level_type)
    if not tilemap:
        tilemap = await _create_fallback_level(level_type)
    return tilemap

# Timeout-protected generation
func _try_generate_full_level(level_type: LevelType) -> TileMap:
    # 5-second timeout with progress checks
    # Returns null if timeout exceeded

# Minimal fallback level
func _create_fallback_level(level_type: LevelType) -> TileMap:
    # Creates simple 20x15 room
    # Always succeeds quickly
```

## Performance Improvements

### Batch Size Optimization
- **Full Level**: 50 tiles/batch (from 500)
- **Fallback Level**: 25 tiles/batch
- **Yield Frequency**: 10x more frequent

### Level Size Optimization
- **Full Level**: 40x30 = 1,200 tiles
- **Fallback Level**: 20x15 = 300 tiles (75% reduction)

### Timeout System
- **Maximum Generation Time**: 5 seconds
- **Automatic Fallback**: Guaranteed completion
- **Progress Tracking**: Phase-by-phase monitoring

## Testing Instructions

### Expected Behavior
1. **Normal Case**: Full level generation completes within 5 seconds
2. **Timeout Case**: Falls back to minimal level automatically
3. **No Freezing**: Game remains responsive throughout

### How to Test
1. Run the game from Godot Editor
2. Select character and start game
3. Monitor console output for:
   - "Generating level of type: CAVE"
   - "Processing X tiles with ultra-small batches..."
   - "Full level generation completed successfully" OR
   - "Creating fallback level..."

### Success Indicators
- ✅ Game loads past character selection
- ✅ Level generation completes without freezing
- ✅ Player can see and move in the generated level
- ✅ UI shows "Level 1: Cavern Depths"
- ✅ No indefinite hanging during generation

### Fallback Indicators
If you see these messages, the fallback system activated:
- "Level generation timed out during..."
- "Creating fallback level..."
- "Fallback level created: 20x15 with 1 room"

## Future Optimizations

### If Still Experiencing Issues
1. **Reduce batch size further** (25 → 10 tiles)
2. **Reduce fallback level size** (20x15 → 15x10)
3. **Add more timeout checkpoints**
4. **Implement progressive level streaming**

### Performance Monitoring
- Watch console for "Tiles processed: X/Y (Z%)" messages
- Monitor frame rate during generation
- Check for memory usage spikes

## Rollback Instructions

If these changes cause issues, you can revert by:
1. Restoring the original `_create_tilemap()` function
2. Removing the new timeout and fallback functions
3. Reverting to the previous batch size of 500

The original working code is preserved in git history.
